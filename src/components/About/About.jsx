         At de_plan, we're on a mission to empower communities to shape the spaces they inhabit. From tackling climate action at a local level to finding solutions for urban issues, we believe that Web3 technology can help bring people together to make a difference. By using geospatial data and working at the hyperlocal level, we're dedicated to building solutions that bridge the gap between the online world and the real world.
