          de_plan has a simple goal, we want the spaces we inhabit to be planned
          by the people who inhabit them. We believe the best mechanisms for
          climate action are at the local/hyperlocal level. We believe the best
          solutions to urban problems are at the community level. We believe
          geospatial data is the first step toward this. And we believe that
          Web3 is the coordination tool to enable these solutions.
